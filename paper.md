# Summary

The Micro Manager facilitates coupling between simulation softwares which solve problems at different scales. Broadly speaking,physics-based simulation analysis is an effective tool to gain insights in real-world scenarios without incurring the high cost of prototyping and testing.
Complex simulations are oftentimes broken down into simpler components which are resolved by specific software tailored to solve the set of problems.
Such complex simulations can be of multi-physics nature, in which different physics is solved in different parts of the domain.
To perform such multi-physics simulations, we can couple different softwares together in a black-box manner. In some scenarios, the coupling is not just for different physics, but also across physical scales.
The Micro Manager, together with the coupling library preCICE [@preCICE_v2], enables such a multiscale, multi-physics coupling between two softwares.
In two-scale coupled scenarios, the coarse scale can be referred to as a macro scale, and the fine scale can be the micro scale. The name *Micro Manager* is derived from its core functionality of controlling a set of micro scale simulations and coupling them to one macro scale simulation via preCICE.

# Statement of need

For multiscale simulations, the physics on different scales are essentially separate problems which are oftentimes evaluated using dedicated software. To understand how the scales affect each other, the software evaluating the scales needs to be coupled in a bi-directional manner.
Two-scale coupled simulations have already been done in several application areas, such as, porous media  [Bringedal_precipitation_dissolution, Bringedal_reactive_porous_media], computational mechanics [@Fritzen_adaptivity] and biomechanics [@Lambers_liver_multiscale].
For each of these applications, the coupling software is implemented from scratch. Such software implementations typically involve communication between the scales, coupling schemes, and other case-specific technical solutions.
[@Groen_multiscale_survey] states that the field of generic multiscale coupling software is still maturing. Already-existing multiscale coupling software like [@MUSCLE3], [@MUI], and [@Amuse] are all tailored to particular multiscale computing patterns.
Compared to these softwares and according to [@Alowayyed_multiscale_exascale], our solution falls into the heterogeneous multiscale computing pattern. For this pattern, high-performance computing (HPC) software is still rare [@Alowayyed_multiscale_exascale]. Application-tailored softwares for multiscale simulations with massively parallel capabilities such as [@Natale_RAS_cancer] exist, but they do not propose a general software solution.
We present a software stack of preCICE and the Micro Manager to couple simulations across scales in an application-agnostic way. preCICE is already able to facilitate coupling on one scale, and together with the Micro Manager, we are able to couple one macro scale simulation with several micro scale simulations.

# Overview

We introduce the concept of the Micro Manager in [@Desai2022micromanager]. The Micro Manager is written in Python and hosted on GitHub. In [@Desai2022micromanager], we describe the version 0.2.1, and in this paper we present version 0.3.0. The Micro Manager is essetially an executable which can be installed on a machine via pip and run directly on the command line. It is designed to work on all major Linux distributions which have Python 3.x support.

The micro simulation software needs to be converted to a callable library so that the Micro Manager can control it. The way to do this is described in the documentation [@MicroManager_documentation]. In the documentation, we demonstrate how to convert a Python or a C++ code into a callable library. Additionally we show a working tutorial of a two-scale heat conduction problem where both the macro and micro scales are solved using the finite element library Nutils [@Nutils7].

The Micro Manager is configured via a JSON file and it can be run directly from the command line or its public methods can be called in a user-written Python file. It can run micro simulations in parallel using MPI [@mpi4py]. For real scenarios, the number of micro simulations can be very high and each micro simulation can be computationally expensive. The Micro Manager is able to adaptively activate and deactive micro simulations depending on whether their similar counterparts exist. The adaptivity strategy is from [@Bastidas_two_scale, @Redeker_adaptivity]. The user chooses between a *local* and *global* adaptivity scheme, both of which are described in detail in the documentation [@MicroManager_documentation].

The user is able to set up a two-scale coupled simulation by modifying an existing micro simulation software into a callable library and configuring the Micro Manager. preCICE and the Micro Manager take care of the coupling and the high-performance computing aspects of the set up so that domain experts can concentrate on the macro and micro-scale models.
